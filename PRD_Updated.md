**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** August 15, 2025
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

SplitTheBill is a lightweight, mobile-first web application designed to help groups split and manage shared expenses easily and transparently. The application addresses the frustration of overcomplicated expense-splitting tools by offering both guest mode (no sign-up required) and registered user accounts, supporting multiple currencies and languages, while maintaining a fast and intuitive user experience.

### Key Value Propositions

*   **No mandatory sign-up** - Instant access through guest mode

*   **Multi-currency and multi-language support** - Global accessibility
*   **Transparent settlements** - Clear breakdown of who owes what
*   **Lightweight and fast** - Under 2.5 seconds on 4G mobile connections

## 2. Problem Statement

Current expense-splitting solutions create friction through:

*   Overcomplicated or sign-up-only apps that require account creation before use
*   Lack of transparency with unclear settlement calculations and breakdowns
*   Limited language or currency support for international or mixed-currency contexts
*   Inconvenience for quick scenarios like restaurant bills or travel expenses
